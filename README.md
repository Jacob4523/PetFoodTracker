## What is the Pet Food Tracker?

The Pet Food Tracker is program that lets you input the amount of hay (in oz), pellets (in oz), and treats (in units; 1 treat = 1 unit). The program takes the values you input and keep a running total of what you have used for each. This program also gives a summary of how much of each you used in the last month, as well as the average daily usage of each food item based on the month you select.

## Why I Made This Program and What the Pet Food Tracker is Useful for

I created the Pet Food Tracker since my family has a pet rabbit at our home. We buy the food she needs through a subscription service on Amazon that requires you to input the frequency that the food arrives at. With this program, we would be able to keep track of how much food we give to our rabbit in a month and use that information to determine how often we should recieve food for her. If not using a subscription service like that, this program would still be useful for determining roughly how often you would need to buy food for a pet rabbit.

## Using the Program

To use the program, simply use the dropdown to select what month you are inputting the data for. After, input the amount of each food item into their respective text boxes and click the add button to add the amount you inputted. This can be done as much as you want. Once you input the amount you want for each, click the monthly summary button to see the running total as well as the daily average usage calculated using the number of days in the month you selected. If you want to reset the values, click the clear button to start over.
